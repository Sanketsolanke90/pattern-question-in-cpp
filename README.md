# ⭐ Pattern Printing Programs in C++

This repository contains **theoretical explanations of classic pattern problems** in C++.  
These problems are **frequently asked in interviews and coding tests** to test loop handling, logic building, and problem-solving ability.

## 📌 Pattern Categories

### 🔹 1. Basic Patterns
- **Right-Angled Triangle** → A simple increasing star pattern.  
- **Inverted Right-Angled Triangle** → Stars decrease row by row.  
- **Number Triangle** → Prints numbers in increasing sequence per row.  
- **Inverted Number Triangle** → Numbers decrease in row length.  

---

### 🔹 2. Pyramid Patterns
- **Pyramid** → A centered triangle formed with stars.  
- **Inverted Pyramid** → A reversed pyramid with stars decreasing upwards.  
- **Diamond** → Combination of pyramid and inverted pyramid.  
- **Hourglass (Sandglass)** → A right-angled triangle increasing, then decreasing.

### 🔹 3. Special Patterns
- **Hollow Square** → A square with stars only at the borders, spaces inside.  
- **Floyd’s Triangle** → Sequential numbers arranged in a triangular shape.  
- **Pascal’s Triangle** → Binomial coefficient triangle (each value = sum of two above).  
- **Butterfly Pattern** → Two right-angled triangles mirrored horizontally, forming butterfly wings.  
- **Hollow Diamond** → Diamond shape with hollow space inside, stars only at edges.  
- **Zig-Zag / Wave Pattern** → Stars arranged in a wave-like structure.  
- **0-1 Triangle** → Triangle where elements alternate between `0` and `1`.

## 🎯 Why Patterns Are Important?
- **Tests understanding of loops** (`for`, `while`) and nested iterations.  
- Helps in **logic building and dry run practice**.  
- Frequently asked in **first-round coding interviews** (TCS, Wipro, Accenture, Infosys, Cognizant, etc.).  
- Improves **thinking ability for larger DSA problems**.

## 📌 Interview Tip
Pattern questions are not about memorization but about:  
1. Identifying **rows and columns**.  
2. Knowing where to place **stars, numbers, or spaces**.  
3. Using conditions (`if-else`) to decide star vs space.
